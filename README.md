# Drinks MI

Before the pandemic, convincing a group of friends to get a drink did not take much work. In fact, the only hard part was deciding _where_ to go. This project has a pretty broadly 
defined scope. Primarily, I'd like to 


# Project Goals 
 1.) Visualize the variance found in particular drink choices 
 2.) Find the most cost effective choice based on how much the bar / resturant must have paid for it 
 3.) Deploy a machine learning model to accurately predict how much a drink ought to cost, and quantify the difference in a dollar value 

# Future Project Growth Opportunities 
 1.) Develop a App / GUI 
 2.) Expand dataset to include other types of drinks: cocktails, mixers, etc. 
 3.) Expand locations, and webscrap for updated prices
